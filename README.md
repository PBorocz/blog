## Péter Böröcz's blog aka *Flirting with Neutrality*

Hi, I'm Péter. This is my blog about various sundry things that cross my mind and have to be written out to get out of my head (think old-man yelling from the porch).

I've never "blogged" before but upon retirement and watching the world go by, this seems as good a time as any to get started. Since github is a (the?) ubiquitous platform for the storage of my Emacs' output, what better place to keep and display content (I tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") but by the time I mastered it, I felt so drained by the experience that I didn't feel like touching it again!)

### Feedback & Credits & Maintenance
* If you see a typo or want to comment, submit a pull request!
* New posts are made via a "release".  You can be notified two ways:
  - [Subscribe to the repo's release RSS feed](https://github.com/PBorocz/blog/releases.atom)
  - Have github notify you of new releases: (click ```Watch -> Custom -> Releases -> Apply```)
* There are no "tags" per se in this implementation...use github search on the repo as I've informally added keywords to all the content.
* Thanks to [David Beazley (aka dabeaz)](https://github.com/dabeaz/blog) for the inspiration to do this in *plain* old github!

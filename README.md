# Péter Böröcz's Blog

Hi, I'm Péter. This is my blog about various sundry things that cross my mind and have to be written out to get out of my head (think old-man yelling from the porch).

I've never "blogged" before but upon retirement and watching the world go by, this seems as good a time as any to get started. Since github is a (the?) ubiquitous platform for the storage of my Emacs' output, what better place to keep and display content (I tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") but by the time I mastered it, I felt so drained by the experience that I didn't feel like touching it again!)

## Feedback & Credits
* If you see a typo or want to comment, submit a pull request!
* There are no "tags" per se in this implementation...use github search as I have informally marked content with keywords.
* Thanks to [David Beazley (aka dabeaz)](https://github.com/dabeaz/blog) for the inspiration to do this in *plain* old github!
